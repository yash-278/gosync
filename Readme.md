# GoSync

GoSync is a distributed file storage system, inspired by services like Google Drive and Dropbox. This project is currently in development and is being used as a learning tool for Golang. It aims to cover various aspects of backend development, including networking, concurrency, database management, and API design.

## Features (Initial Implementation)

### User Authentication and Authorization:

- User signup, login, and authentication using JWT tokens.
- Management of user permissions for file access and sharing.

### File Upload and Download:

- APIs for uploading and downloading files.
- Chunked file upload for handling large files efficiently.
- Storage of files on the server's filesystem or integration with cloud storage services like AWS S3.

### File Management:

- APIs for creating folders, moving files, and renaming files.
- File versioning to track changes and enable rollback.

### Sharing and Collaboration:

- Ability for users to share files or folders with others.
- Implementation of shared folder permissions (view, edit, delete).

### Concurrency and Scalability:

- Use of Go's concurrency features (goroutines and channels) to handle multiple file operations simultaneously.
- Design for scalability, potentially using a microservices architecture.

### Database Integration:

- Use of a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user data, file metadata, and access permissions.
- Implementation of efficient queries for file searching and filtering.

### Security:

- Secure file transfer using HTTPS.
- Implementation of access controls and input validation to prevent unauthorized access and attacks.

### Testing and Deployment:

- Writing of unit and integration tests for APIs and business logic.
- Containerization of the application using Docker and deployment to a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Heroku.

### Bonus Features (Planned):

- Web interface using a frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular) for improved user experience.
- File preview capabilities for common file types (images, PDFs, etc.).
- Integration with third-party services for additional features like full-text search or OCR.
